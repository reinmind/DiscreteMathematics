*Conditional statement*  
Let *p* and *q* be Propositions. The *Conditional statement* *p -> q* is Proposition *if p then q*.  
The *Conditional statement* *p -> q* is false when *p* is true and *q* is false, and true otherwise.  
In the *Conditional statement* *p -> q*. *p* is called the *hypothesis* (or *antecedent or premise*) and *q* is called the *conclusion*(or *consequence*).  
also called *implication*

*hypothesis*  
see above

*conclusion*  
see above  

*converse*  
The Proposition *q -> p* is called *converse* of *p -> q*.

*contrapositive*  
The *contrapositive* of *p -> q* is the Proposition *﹁ q -> ﹁ p*  
always the *contrapositive* has the same true value of *p -> q*

*inverse*  
The *inverse* of *p -> q* is the Proposition *﹁ p -> ﹁ q*  

*equivalent*  
two compound Proposition always have the same truth value we call them *equivalent*
